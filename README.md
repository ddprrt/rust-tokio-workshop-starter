## Working with Codespaces

This project is all set up to be used with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Fork this repository and spin up a codespace on your own.

## Local setup

### Preqrequisites

Before the workshop, make sure you have the correct tools installed and verified. You need:

1. [Rustup Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
2. An editor of your choice (we highly recommmend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + Extensions)

### Install and verify Rust

[Rustup](https://rustup.rs) provides you with all the software to compile and run Rust applications, e.g.

1. Cargo - build tool and package manager
2. `rustfmt` - Auto-formatting tool for Rust code
3. `clippy` - Linting for common mistakes

[and many more](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/). *Rustup* also allows you to install different compile targets and multiple toolchains, as well as keeping your toolchains up to date.

After installing, you should have a set of new command line tools available. 

Verify your *Rust* installation:

1. Open a Terminal/Shell of your choice
2. Navigate to this projects folder
3. Enter

4. Build and run

```bash
$ cargo run
```

If you see compile information and `Hello, world!` printed out on your command line, you are ready to go!
